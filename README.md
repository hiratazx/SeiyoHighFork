# 🎌 Seiyo High — Unscripted AI Visual Novel

**Every choice is unscripted. Every memory is yours.**

Experience the next generation of visual novels where your words shape the souls of those around you. No predetermined paths, no "Game Over" screens—just a living world that evolves with every conversation.

## ✨ What Makes This Different

- **🎭 Total Freedom** — Type anything. Go anywhere. Be anyone. No invisible walls, no "you can't do that."
- **🧠 Deep Psychology** — Characters have real emotional states, motivations, and memories. They remember what you've done.
- **📖 Living Story Arcs** — Multi-chapter narratives that evolve based on your choices, not scripted branching paths.
- **👥 Emergent Characters** — Invent new characters on the fly. Describe them, and they become part of your world.
- **🌸 Seasons & Time** — Play through years of life with changing seasons, weather, holidays, and events.
- **📚 Auto-Generated Novel** — Each day, the AI writes a chapter of YOUR story. Read your adventure as a novel.

## 🎮 How It Works

This is a **text-based visual novel** where you type what your character says and does:

```
Hey Rin, want to grab lunch together?
```
```
*I nervously scratch the back of my head* Look, I need to tell you something...
```

The AI responds as all the other characters and narrates the world around you.
